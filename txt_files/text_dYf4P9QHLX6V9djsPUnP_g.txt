Sorry, just not my kind of place.  Love Triple D, and I've gone to a number of Guy's places.  But Campbell's isn't DD&D material and never will be - way too small a meat pattie in the hamburger - a cook/cashier/clean up guy (oops, no one told him that) behind a really improvised "kitchen counter" - dry bun - soda machines that take space but don't work.

Almost made us want to go back to Lakeside Grill.笑
Wow, this place has it all:  ammo, beer, real estate for sale, and one of the best breakfast sandwiches ever.  the egg is steaming hot and the bacon is crisp.  If you are ever driving through Peoria on your way to Vistancia, stop here and have some grub.笑
This place is pretty cool for everything it has, I finally stopped in for breakfast and the food was OK, the hash brown was like McDonald's but the eggs were good and the biscuits and gravy was some of the best I have had.  The bacon was extra crisp as well and it hit the spot, I now need to try the burger now that Jim H. recommended it so highly.  The fact that you can get all the stuff they have here like Jim said is pretty cool.  Now that the mall area on Lake Pleasant and Happy is around the corner I am sure that this place is less busy and it doesn't help that Walmart is right up the road on Deer Valley either.  This place is a gem and I will do my part to support it.
