Surprisingly, their lemon grass beef was great, well-seasoned and the beef was tender.  Their grilled beef was less exciting but still good when you're in the mood for takeout.  The owners are pleasant.  Definitely good for rainy days when you want comfort Vietnamese food.笑
Worst experience ever. If I had the choice to give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. I ordered vietnamese pho with beef(large), it was by far the worst pho I ever had in my life. if you know how good pho tastes, I would definitely do not recommend going here. There was no natural flavor of the beer as it seemed just powder-like taste and too much salt. The soup base was very dark. I also ordered yellow thai curry with beef and rice, it was basically like soup and all the ingredients in the dish were not fresh at all. 

Stay away.笑
Great food. Reasonable prices on combo for two. Very nice family staff. We loved if and steamed won tons in peanut sauce were excellent.笑
Yup, my cousins and I all agree that this place has the best Bun Bo Hue!!!  I have never tried the pho here but I actually don't think they are known for their pho ... even though their name is Pho Tuong Lai.  

If you like your Bun Bo Hue spicy, you'll have to mention that upfront to the wait staff, otherwise, you won't get very much spice/ heat.  

My brother really liked the Pad Thai - according to him it was the best Pad Thai he's ever had.  I've never been a huge fan of pad thai - more of a pad kee mao girl - so no comment from me!  :)

p.s. There are high chairs available for use - a seemingly rare find for Vietnamese restaurants in Montreal.笑
Not much selections during lunch hours, only one pho choice and the rest are stir-fry dishes. The Spring Roll was delicious and the Beef Pho was wonderful, savory broth that was refreshing at the same time.

The ambience was a little weird, Asian decor with 80's disco music playlist in the background.

The owners were very friendly and the service was excellent.
