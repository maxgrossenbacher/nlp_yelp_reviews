WOW. Great service, Great food! First time here, we were pleasently surprised and loved it! Portions were a bit big, but worth the quality and cost. The added touch of a small bowl of hot apples gave the dish a homey feel. We were seated right away and service was quick, friendly and efficient. 
A must try for the Area!!
Also it has free Wifi!!笑
Tres bon restaurant à dejeuner. Ils offrent aussi une variété de smoothi delicieux. Les serveuses sont toujours souriante et tres efficace. C'est l'endroit parfait pour bien commencer la journée!笑
Bon déjeuner standard. Les saucisses sont des galettes plates... ordinaire.笑
Eggstyle's major problem for me is its pricing vs its value. 

While the quality of the food we ate was decent enough, it lacked portion control. When breakfast plates cost $12-13 each, I'd expect the food I order to have more sides content.

For example my wife ordered the strawberry surprise crepe (check picture). It was very good but where are the sides? Where are the potatoes? The fruits? The toast? FEED ME!!!!

I ordered a ham egg Benedict, it was good. I've had better, it however did come with some potatoes, which were excellent and some fruits... but that's it. Where are my toasts?

Mind you this is a $13 breakfast. I can eat like a king at Cosmopolitan or Allo Mon Coco at this price. It's a hard sell and tough to recommend when there are better options nearby.  Sorry.

Other notes :

- The service was completely overwhelmed, we waited 20+ minutes to sit down (and they had two entrances?). It took our waitress well over 15 minutes to take our order after we flagged her down.

- Free Wifi!笑
Wide variety of breakfast items, Eggstyle has everything from sides and steak & eggs to dessert crêpes. Great quality food, way above that of your usual chain restaurant. Fast service and attentive servers.
