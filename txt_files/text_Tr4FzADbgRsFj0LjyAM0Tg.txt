Classic Quebec mama resto, kind of like a casse croute but with more seating, a covered terasse, and a bar. If you're up on Fleury and just want classics like burgers, souvlaki, pizza, BLT, or a perfect pepperoni sub this is your place. I also had an epic Bloody Ceasar and shared a bunch of laughs with the staff. Not fancy, but comfortable and full of love and smacking of some history and humour.笑
Vous recherchez un déli classique très simple, c'est ici. Pour les lunchs et les soupers, il faut surtout prendre les trucs fait sur place comme les sous-marins ou les pizza.笑
A friend of mine brought me here for dinner... I was pleasantly surprised, it has a decently sized menu featuring home style cooking.

The restaurant itself is decently sized and clean.  Took a few pictures of what we had for dinner... I decided to try the seafood pizza.  The pizza crust was great and homemade, the pizza was really different, rich almost like clam chowder in taste but really tasty.  Also got the poutine au poulet, which is a favourite of mine.  The restaurant delivers everything on their menu, and the brunch menu looks fantastic.  

I'd recommend this restaurant- seems great for eating in, take out, and delivery and the prices are good with ample portions... I'm stuffed!笑
I come to this place for breakfast very often. Good price and lot of food.

Small place but good dishes. 

Variety menus for the breakfast and the lunch.

Nothing bad against.
