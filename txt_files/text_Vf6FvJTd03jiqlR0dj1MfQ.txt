My sympathies on the loss of your business Peter. I can't think of a least deserving person than you to run into such bad luck! After all ..you are an incredible human being..so compassionate, so respectful and so mindful of others at all times. . Good luck in all your future plans..you are a king!笑
Came here for the very first time for my 32nd Birthday for supper . Discovered afterwards the resto turns into a club.enjoyed it so much we stayed till the very end !
Truly enjoyed the Mediterranean cuisine ! Started with all the dips ,my fave was the olive dip! Yum!Ordered  almost everything on the menu from the crispy fried calamari-white wine sauce mussels-stuffed mushrooms -fried zucchini (my favourite ) Greek salad-home baked potatoes-meat platter (chicken was delicious ) -loukaniko.. The list goes on.. Prices were truly affortable !
They have a live DJ as well . Played amazing Greek music then when the club started it was all different kinds of music -Greek-hip hop-Reggaie -salsa etc 
Can't remember the last time we Dansed so much Or even stayed out this late lol. The location is amazing off highway 440 , near the 15... 
Before I left I was also informed during the day this fantastic place offers coffees and Frappé by drive thru!! Wow during this hot weather what exciting news ! And Thursday's they have Salsa lessons ... 
This was my first time but not my last! I highly reccomended笑
