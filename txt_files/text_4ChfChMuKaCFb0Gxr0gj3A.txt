When I was moving in from Laval I just wanted something to share with my friend and girlfriend and I had Pizza's from here before from when I would visit some friends who used to live here. 

For a 2 for 1 place I would say the pizza's are at least decent, when you ask for double cheese and pepperoni 9 out of 10 times you get what you asked for. The sauce is what most 2 for 1 places miss and it`s decent. The fries can be hit and miss, like they don't change the oil enough times, sometimes it`s good and sometimes I regret getting some fries with a pizza.  Price and quality is ok as long you understand this is a 2pour1 and not some fire oven place, don't expect the best you ever had.笑
I have travelled all over Italy and this is still the best pizza I've ever had in my life. Extra cheese :)笑
They would get more stars but my friends pizza what not as well made as mine. Good 2 for one deal over all but why was one pizza 2 times more greasy¿ Their pizza sauce was great, one of the best i had for a 2for1 pizza笑
Lousy pizza. So many other great pizza joints in Chats, avoid this place. Not impressed.笑
This is just your typical 99 cent pizza restaurants (Now charging $1.50), and there are over a dozen of them in Chateauguay now. Unfortunately the quality of their pizzas and questionable cleanliness of the business just doesn't make it worth visiting anymore.

The last pizza I ordered wasn't even full size, and slid around in the box. They also appear to have forgotten to add enough cheese to the pizza, since it was pretty dry.

There is another pizza restaurant that shares the same parking lot, and they have a better deal, to compete with Tony's weekly deal. I never went before, since I wanted to stay loyal to Tony's, but after trying the new place out. I now can save a buck and have a decent tasting pizza.
