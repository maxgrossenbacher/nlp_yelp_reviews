Round little circles of heaven from a drive thru... Enough said.笑
Hubby and I stopped by the other night to grab some donuts for dessert. Spending $1 a donut isn't a great deal, but Krispy Kreme sells the best donuts we've found since moving to Arizona! YUM YUM!笑
Well after 14 check-ins here and many other times I forget to check in...LOL...I regret to tell everyone this location has CLOSED. I don't know what happened but I noticed everything gone out of the building and off the building as well....last week. This locale will be missed.....and I don't know how long it will be before I have another Krispy Creme doughnut.......:((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((....Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
