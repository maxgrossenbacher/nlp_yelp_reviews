"KorniS" Highly recommended  You all should try it..Its Tibs fitfit topped with ground beef (Kitfo), ' Kinche', cottage cheese and Spinch. Yum and good customer service too笑
This was our first introduction to Ethiopian food and the Ethiopian dining experience in general.  We're vegetarians so we had their Vegetarian Platter, followed by the Coffee Ceremony.   The whole "eat with your hands" thing was fun, the food was delicious, and despite us feeling a little like we didn't understand the traditions the staff - and other customers! - were all warm and friendly.  We really enjoyed the Coffee Ceremony which, for reasons I don't understand, comes with a big bowl of ... popcorn ... and ... a bowl of burning bark that billowed an aromatic smoke that filled the ceiling of the restaurant!  Generally speaking, aromas seem to be a big part of the experience, along with interesting spices (not hot per se ... tasty!) that I couldn't quite figure out.  If you want something different and interesting, this is a good place!!笑
I would say in my opinion from all the Ethiopian restaurants on the Danforth strip this would come first. 

They have the best kikil and tibs. 
If you want to experience authentic Ethiopia food tastes this is the place to check out!笑
Best Ethiopian in the city if not one of the best in the continent. If you're looking for authentic and generous portions, this is it. My fiance and I are regulars of this place and though they have changed their waitstaff around often, they've definitely improved on customer service. The owners are always there and are friendly. They have gluten free injera from Ethiopia (you have to ask for it specifically) and I'd recommend it with their "Sora kitfo" and also their alicha tibs. If you're really hungry try the kornis.
