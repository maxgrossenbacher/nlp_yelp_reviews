Maki Maki offers all-you-can eat Japanese in Mississauga.  The food overall was okay, but the service seemed chaotic and the lunch menu was very limited.  We ordered all our items from the very beginning (we had time to review the menu as we waited 30 minutes for a seat).  Midway through eating we realized that we did not receive any of the hand rolls we ordered and the dynamite sushi.  We tried to get the attention of the staff, but with no avail.  We decided to give up on those items and finish up with delicious ice cream (green tea, red bean and mango --- yummy).  When we were about to leave they brought the rolls.  In this place if you don't eat everything you pay extra.  Well, we were full by this time.  So to avoid extra charges the rolls got nicely rolled into napkins and popped into my purse.  It will be awhile before I come back :(.笑
This is my favourite all-you-can-eat sushi place right now.  While the food is just good (not the best I've had), the service is superb.  We have become regulars at this restaurant and the waitress, who seems to be there all the time, treats us like part of her family.

They offer a good variety - aside from the regular sushi, maki and sashimi they also offer interesting appetizers like ribs, rare beef and several fried foods.  They now also offer a small buffet section and a serve-yourself ice cream bar.  Interesting ice cream options include mango, green tea and ginger.

Warning: there is a time limit and the clock starts ticking when you are seated, so start eating as soon as you can!笑
Went back after months of not going, and sorry to say I've had to take one star away. First, Annie is gone! And two, the restroom is dirty! And that's always a big deal, especially that they serve raw food. So although the food is still great, might not be back for a while.笑
All you can eat. They are good but they seem to rush you. I don't think they like BIG eaters.笑
I love the server here.  She was so sweet and adorable!  She saw that we weren't able to order a lot of food, so she made a bunch of orders for us.  The kitchen was a bit slow when I went, but the food was decent. 

However, for around $30, I was expecting better quality food.  A lot of the food was a bit overcooked and over seasoned.  The best thing I ate here was the salmon sashimi.  Mmmmm.  I also loved the thin slices of beef wrapped around mushrooms and green onion.  The warm sake was pretty good, but boo to not having Sake Bombs!  They have a good variety of drinks that anyone would want with sushi, so that was pretty nice though.  

Maybe the bay has spoiled me when it comes to sushi, so I don't know if I am being unfair on my rating.  Even tough the service was slow, they were super friendly and accommodating.  

The place is also super clean, including the bathrooms!  Hahaha.  Am I the only person that determines if I would go back according to the bathrooms?笑
My last visit there we were victimized by the angriest waitress ever, what kind of psycho puts our menus on a nearby chair and then gets upset when we can't find them and ask to see a menu?

Follow that up with slow service, and overpriced below average food.

I'm so happy to hear that Maki Maki has closed.笑
I absolutely hated sushi before my experience with Maki Maki. Mind you, I was closed minded because I thought sushi was only about raw salmon, etc. But my experience at Maki Maki changed all that.

The Good:

- OMG: spider rolls!!! they're huge!!!!! nice fried crab...so worth it just for this!!
- tons of selection so even if you're not a sushi fan, there will be something for you including soup, vegetarian dishes and meat dishes
- drinks are included in the price and so is dessert
- the servers are really nice and friendly
- if you're there with a big group, there's a room where you sit on the floor and have privacy..really cute!

The Bad:

- I guess with most sushi places, it's a little more expensive (around $22-25 for dinner)
- Again, I think with most sushi places there's a time limit (and because I'm a time oriented person, I always feel rushed)
- there are no descriptions as to what each item is so if you're brand new, you are ordering blind

Overall, great experience everytime (went for New Years and it was awesome!) I recommend it if you're in Mississauga
