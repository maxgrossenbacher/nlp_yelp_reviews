Looks like this place is out of business.  The phone is disconnected, but I haven't been by to verify.笑
Best Burger really does have some of the best burgers. I haven't been in a while, mainly due to the fact that I moved and they just have the weirdest hours, but it is still what I think of when I think of a good burger. I tried it because my school was in the area, and it used to deliver for lunch (what can I say, I loathe cafeteria food) for free, so I figured why not give it a try. I had (and continue to eat) their bacon cheeseburger, which is huge by the way. The bacon is fresh and the meat is juicy. The sauce... oh the sauce... I eat it on my french fries and with the burger. Their desserts include milkshakes (although they spell(ed) it deserts for the longest) and their oreo is pretty good if you don't want to travel to Sonic. Oh, I miss the Japanese-American owners who always smiled when our club from school walked in, but I shall return.笑
With a name like "Best Burger," I had to give it a try. I got the cheeseburger and my girlfriend got the 1/3 lb best burger and they were better than your average burger. I definitely recommend this over your ordinary fast food chain- the burgers weren't greasy and the toppings were fresh. Their fries and milkeshake weren't bad, either. 

So, when you first walk in, it seems like you've stumbled into a small sushi bar. That's b/c it is a sushi place now!  Best Burger has become a double agent and is also called Sushi Bong.  They feature your usual takeout Japanese favorites rice bowls, rolls, salads etc...  But, it does not end there they also have Korean BBQ. 

When you can't decide between a burger and fries or a spicy tuna hand roll, wait no longer now you can get both at the same place.  

Good burgers (pretty cheap,  less than $6 for a burger, friends, and drink), friendly service. I'd definitely come here again to get my cheap sushi or burger fix.
