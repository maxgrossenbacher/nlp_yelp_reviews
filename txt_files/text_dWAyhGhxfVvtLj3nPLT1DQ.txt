Prix Fix Menu Daily from 5:30 pm - 7:00 pm... A little too early for dinner but a deal is a deal and I am into specials... So I made a reservation using Opentable for a 6:30 pm early dinner at Left Bank.

Talking about specials, I opt for the Wine Glass of the Day ($6) - Sangria... which is quite good... refreshing for a hot summer evening. You can also bring your own wine for $5 corkage fee Sunday to Tuesday... I guess I going to bring my own next time!! 

Prix Fix ($27) 

Organic Salad 
- boring prepackaged mixed green.. but the dressing has this little peppercorn kick to it... 
- sizable portion enough for 2... but I might just opt for the Soup of the Day instead

Ontario Trout
- cooked perfectly: crispy on the outside and moist on the inside
- love the chunky almond sauce: Amandine

Creme Caramel 
- smooth and rich with flavour but light at the same time!
- Banana cooked in liquor and covered in chantilly cream on the side round off the dessert with different texture and elements

We also ordered

Steamed Mussel ($10)
- The broth is so so so good... enough flavour to just compliment the freshness of the mussels.... I was using a spoon to drink it like a soup!!

Braised Lamb Shank ($19)
- great value as the dish is good portion with a lot of sides of fresh vegetables!
- Tender and well flavoured...Even the brandy and caramelized onion sauce is light and not overpowering

Service is excellent especially from our waiter who is patient and knowledgeable. 

Huge covered patio or if you prefers the dining room is also well appointed... great for a romantic date....

Left Bank Bistro is a good choice if you are looking somewhere for some decent food and a great price point!!笑
Third visit and not too pleased. We booked a table 4 days in advance and when we arrived we were told that our table had been given away. It was suggested that we sit at the bar until a table was available. We decided that if we were not seated after we finished our cocktails at the bar that we would leave. The bartender was upset that this had happened and went over and above to ensure that we were seated as soon as possible. Kudos to him! We were seated within 20 minutes. The place was absolutely packed and buzzing...really loud! The mussels were fabulous but the onion soup was so loaded with croutons and I could barely find an onion let alone the broth. That said, the flavour was very good. The shortrib bourguignon was very tender, but fatty and lacking flavour and the veg was underdone. Brussels sprouts were hard as a rock. The trout was very good. Our first two vistis were fabulous but we will not return.笑
Upon entering this large restaurant the sign says "We are now serving Fred's Bread". Good move. The dinner starts off with phenomenal breadsticks and fresh cut baguette which is a rarity. Its this attention to details that makes a difference. The staff are experienced and seem to enjoy what they are doing.  

The menu accommodates the mid-town location, surrounded by a lot of competition by including an appetizer of frites and a burger on the menu, but make no mistake someone here really knows what they are doing in the kitchen! 

The fried calamari appetizer and salads were yum. The main courses; duck breast, papardello pasta w. beef bourgignon, steak frites and jumbo scallops were all delicious.  

There were a few empty tables on a Saturday Night - but compared to the dozens of crappy Italian and French restaurants in town, this place should be packed and lined up down the street!  Prices are very fair. Don't hesitate -- this place is good.笑
This place was amazing!  The service was not a 100% but i admit it was very busy when we arrived, also they redeemed them selves by acknowledging the slower service and apologized.  The food was portioned according to its price.  The French Onion Soup and Muscles were great. Also the gnocchi and steak frites were very flavorful.  The sticky toffee was GREAT!, the black forest was not so great (Dry and disappointing).  Great wine selection and best of all, friendly service.  They also have prix fix during certain times.  
2 appatizers, 2 mains, 2 deserts, glass of wine and Diet Coke was around $100 plus tip.
