Way overpriced for what tastes like canned soup. You can get better soup at Longos for close to half the price or just go sit down at a proper restaurant and pay the same price! Ridiculous.笑
I would have rated Soup-it-up 4 stars but the service is so slow.  Other soup places serve more customers way faster.  They need more staff and a second cashier.  They have 2 cash registers and a huge slow line up with one cashier.   As I was standing in line 2 people ahead of me left to go somewhere else because it was so slow.  They walked by me with lunch a few minutes later and I was waiting for the poor staff to catch up at the cashier bottleneck.

Lots of selection - 3 sizes and varieties.  Vegetarian, beef, chicken, and cream based soups.  Mix the soup with one of their bread options- sour dough, white, multi grain.  

If they could serve faster I would go more often.  The soup is great but lots of standing and waiting, watching your bowl of soup sit in line while the staff franticly catch up.笑
Very lacklustre soup and they charge a bit for sides like bread. I ordered the chicken noodle (which I've also eaten at Soup Nutsy so I can fairly compare). I don't exaggerate when I say it was pathetic and tasted nothing better than canned stuff. The noodle was so overcooked, the broth had no flavour except salt, and there really was nothing to this. Very different from the Soup Nutsy chicken noodle soup, which was quite delicious compared to this. With only one specialty (soup), how difficult is it to make it tasty?笑
This place is definitely a miss. Tried it once for lentil soup and it had a weird powdery after taste and seemed a bit watered down. Gave it another shot - tried the veggie chili - basically tomato soup with mushy beans - no veggies in sight.
